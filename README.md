 Qualcomm's Secure Execution Environment Privilege Escalation Vulnerability Exploit
 This Qualcomm-based vulnerability affected most devices at the time, as it was contained in a trustlet that was designed to be able to execute in the same manner on many different devices. Further, on some devices the vulnerable code was present but appeared slightly different, making it even more difficult to identify. To identify this issue, users must reverse-engineer the trustlet using the tools available to check for the vulnerability.
